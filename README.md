# 🔍 Object Detection with Python & OpenCV

Welcome to the **Object Detection** repository! This project demonstrates how to use Python and OpenCV to perform object detection on various input images. It includes a robust detection pipeline that identifies objects within images using pre-trained machine learning models, highlighting them with bounding boxes.

## 🌟 Features

- 📸 **Real-Time Detection**: Leverage OpenCV’s capabilities to detect objects in real-time using webcam or video files.
- 🧠 **Pre-Trained Models**: Uses popular models like YOLO, SSD, or Haar Cascades for accurate object identification.
- 💡 **Customizable**: Easily modify the detection parameters and models to suit your specific use case.
- 🔍 **Bounding Boxes**: Clearly outlines detected objects in images for easy identification.
